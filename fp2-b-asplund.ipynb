    "#### Does project fp2-b work fully, partialy, or not at all?\n",
    "The project works in accordance with the assignment requirements. It reads the text from the file, parses it into a dictionary of word counts, and then uses that dictionary to answer the questions prompted.\n",
    "#### Discuss what you have achieved\n",
    "The big takeaway for this assignment was finding ways to work with the dictionary. For example, in one part of the assignment, the data in the dictionary had to be sorted by the values. In another part, the keys had to be extracted and sorted by length. These manipulations were different than things that had been done previously."
